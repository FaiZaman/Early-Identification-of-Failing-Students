# Early-Identification-of-Failing-Students

We use learning analytics and machine learning to predict whether a student will fail their course. The dataset used is the Open University Learning Analytics dataset. VLE statistics and student demographic data was used in the prediction

The ML models used are:

- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

We also used a Multi-Layer Perceptron, and balanced the pass/fail classes by oversampling.
